# Final-Project

This is for the final project. In a group of four people, myself and my peers (Isaac Law, Roy Torres, and Shea Cronin) worked through the tasks and challenges contained within the final project. This project was incredibly in depth, with several flags to capture. We had cracked a machine, and then explained how we had cracked the machine in detail for the class.
